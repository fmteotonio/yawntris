# Yawntris

Yawntris was done for the 2020 edition of #lowrezjam in a little under two weeks, under the theme It's Not Really There. It is a variant of the typical falling-block game in which after some time, the camera blinks and an unexpected event occurs, making players change their course of action. Several events may occur such as pieces disappearing, weird pieces falling, and even parts of the playing field disappearing.
